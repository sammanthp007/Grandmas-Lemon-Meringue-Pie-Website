                About Us
            </h2>
            <p>
            We started when Mrs. Granny Smith started making pie for the
            local community on sundays as part of her hobby to cook pies, in 1934.
            Since then, her family has supported her venture to open up a
            business and expand the reach of her tasty pies in the belly of
            10000 cities. This expansion shows our dedication to consistantly
            provide finger licking tasty pies. Our current <strong>mission
                statement</strong> is
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>
                To achieve a society where people start refering to
                <q>Pies</q> as <q>Granny's pie</q> and actually start
                calling <q>Pies</q> as <q>Granny's</q>.</em>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            Currently, we have stores open in
            2000 cities and we provide online delivery to 10,000 cities
            globally.
